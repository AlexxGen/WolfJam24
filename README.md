Truck Alone is a 2D narrative game following a mail delivery man in a post apocalyptic world. Feeling lonesome and isolated, the man doesn't know what to do other than his job. By delivering the letters remaining in his truck, he hopes to build connections even after everything has gone to shit.

How to play:
1. Locate the letter on your dashboard and click to see the address
2. Locate the clipboard and find the frequency that matches the address
3. Locate the radio and set it to the correct frequency
4. Locate the call icon and press to start broadcasting
5. Locate the letter on your dashboard and click twice to read the content of the letter
6. As the callers speak to you about the letter, pay close attention and inquire to see if they are truly the owner of the letter
7. Once you've determined the correct caller, click deliver, and on the map, drive around with WASD until you find the correct city to deliver the letter
8. Repeat + enjoy!
